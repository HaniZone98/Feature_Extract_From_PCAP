   1) Importing Libraries:
        The script starts by importing necessary libraries including struct, scapy, numpy, and pandas. These libraries provide various functions and tools for working with network packets and data manipulation.

   2) Reading PCAP File:
        The script uses the rdpcap() function from Scapy to read packets from a PCAP file named "47.pcap". It stores the packets in the variable pcap_file.

   3) Initialization:
        Several variables are initialized to hold different attributes of the packets.

   4) Packet Processing Loop:
        The script iterates through each packet in the pcap_file.

   5) Packet Filtering:
        It checks if each packet has the layer "IP" or an IP layer using haslayer("IP") or haslayer(IP). If it does, the packet is processed; otherwise, it's skipped.

   6) Packet Attribute Extraction:
        For each packet, various attributes such as packet number, length, Ethernet source and destination addresses, IP version, IP header length, TCP flags, TCP sequence numbers, etc., are extracted and appended into separate lists.

   7) Handling IPv6 Packets:
        If a packet is not IPv4, it is considered IPv6 and added to the IPV6 list.

   8) Data Validation and Transformation:
        Some attributes like round-trip time (RTT) and congestion window (CWND) are calculated or extracted from packet data.

   9) DataFrame Creation:
        After processing all packets, a Pandas DataFrame is created using the collected lists. Each list corresponds to a column in the DataFrame.

   10) Exporting to CSV:
        Finally, the DataFrame is exported to a CSV file named "47.csv" using the to_csv() method.

Overall, this script is designed to extract and analyze various attributes of network packets from a PCAP file and store them in a structured format for further analysis or visualization using tools like Pandas and Numpy
